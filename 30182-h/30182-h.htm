<h2>A JUBALEE PERFORMANCE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;After <i>The Cotter's Saturday Night</i>, which is a fine
broad Scotch setting of Rantin' Roarin' Robbie's poem, came <i>The Dream
of Jubal</i>. This, as I take it, was a work produced in the Jubalee Year.
I don't know who <span class="smcap">Jubal</span> was, at least I've only a vague idea. Rather
think he was a partner of <span class="smcap">Tubal</span>, <span class="smcap">Tubal, Jubal &amp; Co.</span>, Instrument Makers.
From this Oratorio I gather that <span class="smcap">Jubal</span> was an enthusiastic amateur, but
that the only musical instrument he possessed was a
tortoise-shell,&mdash;whether comb or simple shell I couldn't quite make out.
However, comb or shell, he worked hard at it, until one morning, when he
was practising outside the house (I expect <span class="smcap">Tubal &amp; Co.</span> wouldn't stand
much of it indoors), the birds started a concert in opposition to his
solo. This quite drowned his feeble notes, and drove him half frantic.
In despair he lay down under the shade of a tree and fell asleep, and in
his dreams he saw the instrument which he had invented gradually
developed into a "Strad", and from that into the most glorious
instrument of our time; namely, the banjo. This so soothed and pleased
him, that, waking up, he adorned his tortoise-shell with flowers, and
sang aloud to all his descendants in all time and tune, and out of all
time and tune, if necessary, to join him in praising the invention of
Music generally, and of this Jubalee instrument in particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Joseph Bennett</span> has given a most effective description of the dream;
the accompanied recitation being very fine indeed, and splendidly
performed by Miss <span class="smcap">Julia Neilson</span>, who, like <span class="smcap">Jubal</span>, has been in the Tree's
Shadow at the Haymarket. Fine triumphal march and chorus. Your own
<span class="smcap">Maggie McIntyre</span>, and your Mr. <span class="smcap">Barton McGuckin</span>, were in excellent form,
and everybody was delighted, with the exception of one person,&mdash;who is
always <i>&agrave; peu pr&egrave;s</i>, never quite satisfied, and therefore rightly named,</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">All-but Hall, S.W.</span>"</p>

<hr />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Harlowe there!</span>"&mdash;This now familiar exclamation might be appropriately
adopted as the motto of the Vaudeville Theatre during the run of
<i>Clarissa</i>. She does run, too, poor dear&mdash;first from home, then from
<i>Lovelace's</i>, and then "anywhere, anywhere, out of the world!" By the
way, is it quite fair of Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Thorne</span>, in the absence of a friend
and brother comedian, to speak of himself, as he does in this piece, as
"a mere Toole"? How can such a metamorphosis have taken place? We trust
that Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Thorne</span>, Temporary Tragedian, will amend his sentiments.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Sir W. V. Harcourt</span>, on the night when he was so huffy, "left the House."
True: he certainly did not "carry the House with him."</p>

<h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type-Writer.</i>)<br /><br />

No. IV.&mdash;THE GIDDY SOCIETY LADY.</center>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/124.png">
<img src="images/124.png" width="100%" alt="THE GIDDY SOCIETY LADY" /></a>
</div>

<p>The Giddy Lady is one who, having been plunged at an early age into
smart society, is whirled perpetually round in a vortex of pleasures and
excitements. In the effort to keep her head above water, she is as
likely as not to lose it. This condition she naturally describes as
"being in the swim." In the unceasing struggle to maintain herself
there, she may perhaps shorten her life, but she will apparently find a
compensation in the increased length of her dressmaker's bills. She is
ordinarily the daughter of aristocratic parents, who carefully allowed
her to run wild from the moment she could run at all. By their example
she has been taught to hold as articles of her very limited faith, that
the serious concerns of life are of interest only to fools, and should,
therefore (though the inference is not obvious), be entirely neglected
by herself, and that frivolity and fashion are the twin deities before
whom every self-respecting woman must bow down.</p>

<p>Having left the Seminary at which she acquired an elementary ignorance
of spelling, a smattering of French phrases as used by English lady
novelists, and a taste for music which leads her in after-life to prefer
Miss <span class="smcap">Bessie Bellwood</span> to <span class="smcap">Beethoven</span>, she is soon afterwards brought out at
a smart dance in London. From this point her progress is rapid. Balls
and concerts, luncheons and receptions, dinners and theatres, race
meetings and cricket matches, at both of which more attention is paid to
fashion than to the field, follow one another in a dizzy succession. She
has naturally no time for thought, but in order to avoid the least
suspicion of it, she learns to chatter the slang of the youthful
Guardsmen and others who are her companions. A certain flashing style of
beauty ensures to her the devotion of numerous admirers, to whom she
babbles of "chappies" and "Johnnies," and "real jam" and "stony broke,"
and "two to one bar one," as if her life depended upon the correct
pronunciation of as many of these phrases as possible in the shortest
time on record. She thus comes to be considered a cheerful companion,
and at the end of her third season, marries a jaded man of pleasure,
whose wealth is more considerable than his personal attractions, and
who, for some inscrutable reason, has been approved by her parents as a
suitable husband.</p>

<p>She treats matrimony as an emancipation from rules which she has rarely
seen any one else observe, and has never honoured herself, and after a
few years, she becomes one of that gaudy band of Society ladies who
follow with respectful imitation the giddy vagaries of the Corinthians
of a lower grade. She dines often without her husband at smart
restaurants, where she has constant opportunities of studying the
manners of her models. She adores the burlesques at the Gaiety and the
Avenue, and talks, with a complete absence of reserve and a disregard of
pedantic accuracy, about the lives and adventures of the actresses who
figure there. She can tell you, and does, who presented <span class="smcap">Lottie A.</span> with a
diamond star, and who was present at the last supper-party in honour of
<span class="smcap">Tottie B.</span> Nor is she averse to being seen and talked about in a box at a
Music-Hall, or at one of the pleasure-palaces in Leicester Square. She
allows the young men who cluster round her to suppose that she knows all
about their lapses from strict propriety, and that she commends rather
than condemns them. <i>Causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i> are to her a staple of
conversation, her interest in them varying directly as the number of
co-respondents.</p>

<p>It is impossible, therefore, that the men who are her friends should
treat her with that chivalrous respect which an obsolete tradition would
seem to require, but they suffer no loss of her esteem in consequence.
Such being her behaviour in the society of men, the tone of her daily
conversation with friends of her own sex may be readily imagined, though
it might not be pleasant to describe. Suffice it to say, that she sees
no shame in addressing them, or in allowing herself to be addressed by a
name which a Court of law has held to be libellous when applied to a
burlesque actress. She is always at Hurlingham or the Ranelagh, and has
seen pigeons killed without a qualm. She never misses a Sandown or a
Kempton meeting; she dazzles the eyes of the throng at Ascot every year,
and never fails at Goodwood.</p>

<p>Twice a year the Giddy Lady is compelled by the traditions of her caste
to visit Paris, in order to replenish her exhausted wardrobe. On these
occasions she patronises only the best hotel, and the most expensive and
celebrated of men-dressmakers, and she is "fitted" by a son of the
house, of whom she talks constantly and familiarly by his Christian name
as <span class="smcap">Jean</span>, or <span class="smcap">Pierre</span>, or <span class="smcap">Philippe</span>. During the shooting season she goes
from country-house to country-house. She has been seen sometimes with a
gun in her hands, often with a lighted cigarette between her lips.
Indeed she is too frequent a visitor at shooting-luncheons and in
smoking-rooms, where a woman, however much she may attempt to disguise
her sex, is never cordially welcomed by men. The conventions of the
society in which she moves seem to require that she should be attended
during her visits by a <i>cavaliere servente</i>, who is therefore always
invited with her. Their pastime is to imitate a flirtation, and to
burlesque love, but neither of them is ever deceived into attributing
the least reality to this occupation, which is often as harmless as it
is always absurd.</p>

<p>These and similar occupations, of course, leave her no time to attend to
her children, who are left to grow up as best they may under the
fostering care of nursery-maids and of such relations as may choose,
from time to time, to burden themselves with the olive-branches of
others. Her husband has long since retired from all competition with
her, and leaves her free to follow her own devices, whilst he himself
follows the odds. She is often supposed to be riding for a fall. It is
certain that her pace is fast. Yet, though many whisper, it is quite
possible that she will ride to the end without open damage.</p>

<p>Of her dress and her jewels it need only be said that she affects
tailor-made costumes and cat's-eye bangles by day, and that at night she
escapes by the skin of her teeth from that censure which the scantiness
of her coverings would seem to warrant, and which Mr. <span class="smcap">Horsley</span>, R.A., if
he saw her, would be certain to pronounce.</p>

<p>In middle age she loses her brilliant complexion. Yet, for reasons best
known to herself, her colour continues to be bright, though her spirits
and her temper seem to suffer in the effort to keep it so. As old age
advances, she is as likely as not to become a gorgon of immaculate
propriety, and will be heard lamenting over the laxity of manners which
permits girls to do what was never dreamt of when she was a girl
herself.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE PINT OF IT.</h2>

<p>How curious that our youngest boy, aged fifteen months, should have
already become partially paralysed, and be afflicted, besides, with
an&aelig;mia, rickets, and growing inability to digest the smallest particle
of food!</p>

<p>If it were not that we procure our milk from the "Hygienic Unskimmed
Lacteal Fluid and Food for Babes Company, Limited," I should begin to
believe that there might be something wrong with the beverage which
forms the staple of his infantile dietary.</p>

<p>The Company professes to sell milk "pure from the cow." From the quality
of this morning's supply, I should be inclined to fancy that that cow is
suffering from an advanced stage of atrophy.</p>

<p>As our eldest child, aged two-and-a-half, is still totally unable to
walk, and its legs have become mere shrivelled sticks, I really must
call in an Analyst to test our milk.</p>

<p>Heavens! The Analyst reports that more than half the cream has been
"separated"&mdash;which seems to mean removed&mdash;and that its place has been
supplied by "65 per cent. of impure water."</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, I hardly think that the fine of five
shillings, and half-a-crown costs, which the Magistrate has inflicted on
the Company, quite meets the justice of the case, or will be sufficient
to stop such adulteration in the future.</p>

<h2>"GRENADIERS TO THE FRONT!"</h2>

<p>I must confess, my dear Editor, I was greatly gratified at your
gracefully recognising my twenty years' service, spent in the defence of
my <span class="smcap">Queen</span> and my country (in the Militia), by asking me to be present at
the initial performance of the Guards Burlesque Company of <i>Fra Diavolo</i>
in the Theatre Royal, Recreation Room, Chelsea Barracks, S.W.</p>

<p>The place was not entirely new to me. Last year it had been my good
fortune to see <i>Ivanhoe</i>, with Mr. <span class="smcap">Nugent</span> in the principal character&mdash;a
gallant and talented gentleman, who was, alas! conspicuous by his
absence on the present occasion. I was given to understand that this
year the Grenadiers were ordered "to the front," and that the command
had been obeyed, the list of the <i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i> amply proved.</p>

<p>The 19th Sent'ry Guards Burlesque.</p>
</div>

<p>The music was admirably selected by Mr. <span class="smcap">Edward Solomon</span>, the "<i>Baker
Roll</i>" from <i>Pickwick</i> going capitally. The scenery, by the Hon. <span class="smcap">Arnold
Keppel</span> (late Scots Guards), was good, and "the writing up to date," by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Yardley</span> (never to be forgotten on the field of cricket), was better.</p>

<p>For the rest, I may say that the Guards' Burlesque Company, from a
theatrical professional stand-point, were hardly "Gaiety form," but, as
amateurs, they were simply magnificent. There was no supper&mdash;but this is
a detail. Yours sincerely,</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>The Walery-Gallery Co.&mdash;for <span class="smcap">Walery</span> has transformed himself into a
Limited Liability&mdash;is bringing out a series of "Sporting Celebrities,"
with sporting notes, monographs, and dramatic notes too. The photographs
are excellent. Two in each monthly number. The monographs are right
enough, but the sporting and dramatic notes in a monthly, are either not
sufficient or too much. Three portraits and three monographs, one
sportswoman and two sportsmen in each number would be better, at least,
so it seems to the learned Baron, who would sum up the requisites for
making the Walery-Gallery Sporting Series a success in a Shakspearian
quotation, adapted for this special occasion,&mdash;"More art and less
matter."</p>

<p>The Baron is always much interested in the <i>Revue de Famille</i>, directed
and largely contributed to by M. <span class="smcap">Jules Simon</span>, who is also a pretty
regular contributor to its pages. In December last, M. <span class="smcap">Simon</span> wrote a
thoughtful and interesting article on <i>L'Education des Femmes</i>, and M.
<span class="smcap">Francisque Sarcey</span>, a very amusing paper on <i>Le Timide au Th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>. The
number for February (it is only a bi-monthly publication) has a paper on
<i>L'Influence</i> (not the influenza) <i>des Femmes en France</i>, the only fault
of which is its length; and <span class="smcap">Gyp</span> gives a satirical sketch called <i>Nos
Docteurs</i>, which hardly seems in keeping with the family character of
the <i>Revue</i>. The March Number is now out, and can be procured at
<span class="smcap">Hachette's</span>. It is one of the best French serials.</p>

<p>A delightful book is <i>Yorkshire Legends and Traditions</i>, collected and
recounted by the Rev. <span class="smcap">Thomas Parkinson</span>. He who writes of fairies and of
witches should of course possess some potent spell&mdash;(how many members of
the School-Board, had they lived a couple of hundred years ago, would
have been punished as witches for teaching "spelling," it is pleasant to
imagine)&mdash;and Mr. <span class="smcap">Parkinson's</span> great charm is his apparent belief in the
wonders he relates. Even when he occasionally alludes to "popular
superstition," you feel it is only a phrase introduced evidently out of
consideration for the unphilosophic prejudices of his "so-called"
Nineteenth-Century readers, who pride themselves on being <span class="smcap">Huxleys</span> in the
full blaze of scientific light, and yet would shrink from passing a
night in a haunted room, or, if alone, would go a mile out of their way
to avoid an uncanny spot. The greatest mistake made by narrators of the
marvellous is attempting to account for the unaccountable. This book is,
I believe, one of a series now being published by <span class="smcap">Elliot Stock</span>, of
Paternoster Row, a stock which Your Own Baron recommends as a safe
investment, for the book alone is a good dividend, the interest being
kept up all through; and it is satisfactory to hear that, as the other
counties of England, and perhaps of Ireland and Scotland, are being
dealt with in a similar manner, there is a good reserve-fund of
information and amusement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Runciman</span>, in <i>The Fortnightly</i>, brings a serious indictment of
plagiarism against Mr. <span class="smcap">Rider Haggard</span>, which it strikes me he would be
unable to sustain in a Court of Common Sense before <span class="smcap">Mr. President Punch</span>,
unless it were first laid down as a fixed principle, that a writer of
fiction must never have recourse to any narrative of facts whereon to
base his Romance.</p>

<h2>MORE TO FOLLOW.</h2>

<p>The dinner given by Mr. <span class="smcap">James Staats Forbes</span>, Chairman of the L.C. &amp; D.
Railway, last Wednesday, to M. <span class="smcap">Eiffel</span>, and the French Engineers, was a
big success. As the <i>P. M. G.</i>, which, being now edited by a <i>chef</i>,&mdash;at
least, he is a man-Cook,&mdash;authoritatively informed us, in anticipation
of this feast, "The Continent and Great Britain have been ransacked for
delicacies." There is to be another banquet, we hear, and more
"ransacking." Once again will that delightfully-entertaining Chairman,
<span class="smcap">J. S. Forbes</span>, of the Lucullus Chatting and Dining Line, present a menu
which will be unexampled in culinary history. By great favour we are
permitted to present a few of the delights of this bill of fare, in
which a <span class="smcap">Soyer</span> would have rejoiced, a <span class="smcap">Ude</span> have delighted, and of which a
<span class="smcap">Brillat-Savarin</span> might indeed have been proud. No expense in ransacking
has been spared. They are sending to the prairie for prairie oysters; to
Egypt for <i>Pot-au-feu (soupe &agrave; la mauvaise femme)</i>; to Jerusalem for
artichokes, to Bath for chaps, and Brussels for sprouts. Bordeaux will
be ransacked for pigeons, Scotland for Scotch woodcock, Wales for
rabbits, Sardinia for sardines, and Turkey for rhubarb. Special
messengers are travelling through Germany in search of sausages; others
are in Ireland seeking supplies of the stew of that country. Bombay is
being ransacked for its celebrated Bombay ducks, Guinea for fowls,
Norfolk for dumplings, and Chili for vinegar. Merchant traders are
already in treaty with Madeira for cakes; and while Naples is being
ransacked for ices, the Government Stationery Office at home will yield
an almost inexhaustible supply of wafers.</p>

<p>The guests, led by a choir arrayed in twenty-four sheets, also supplied
by the Stationery Office, will sing a delightful compound of the
drinking chorus in <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i>, and "<i>The Bonnets of
Bonny Dundee</i>," which will go as follows, all (who can) standing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Let's fill up our glasses with treacle and ink,</p>
<p class="i2">And anything else that is pleasant to drink,</p>
<p class="i0">And hook the best port and let us gay free,</p>
<p class="i2">And hurrah for <span class="smcap">Staats Forbes</span> and the L. C. &amp; D.!</p>
</div></div>

<p>We can only give these few hints, as of course, this is but a small
portion of the <i>menu</i>, a mere pennyworth to any amount of ransacking.</p>

<h2>"LE KICKE-BALL" IN FRANCE.</h2>

<center>(<i>A Vindication.</i>)</center>

<p><span class="smcap">Mon Cher Monsieur Punch</span>,&mdash;That you have been the victim of "a 'oax,"
crafty, ingenious, and abominable, there is now no shadow of a doubt.
That letter palmed off on to your good and trustful nature the week
before last, with the signature of "<span class="smcap">Le Heads Masterre</span>," professing to
deal with the subject of the International athleticism, I should
unfailingly pronounce, after cursory investigation, to be a forgery,
impudent and profound. For survey the facts: while it proposed, in a set
of regulations <i>bizarre</i> and fantastic, to abolish "Le 'Arf-back," as a
superfluous officer in the French game, a contest took place in the very
centre of this Paris, in which not only the "'Arf-back," but the
"Three-quarterre-back" was referred to as having been <i>changed four
times in the progress of one game</i>! Nor was this all. So highly and
efficiently trained by the indefatigable Principal had been the French
"'Ome-team," that,&mdash;glorious announcement to make,&mdash;they succeeded in
carrying off the victory, not merely from one of your Public School
Clubs, representing only one country, but from a united "<i>Onze</i>," that
might have been regarded with a natural and excusable patriotic pride,
as the combined force of all the whole civilised world. Yes, the force
opposed to our courageous youths of the <i>Lyc&eacute;e Janson de Sailly</i>
comprised not only Englishmen, but other nationalities, including sons
of the American United States and Holland. Against this formidable
combination the active and sportsmanlike youth of our re-awakened
athletic France scored a victory, easy, swift, and complete, of two
tries to nothing.</p>

<p>For further particulars, I refer you to the newspapers of the period,
that furnish the details of the affair. In them you will see that, so
far from "<i>Le Scrimmage</i>" being abandoned, on the contrary, several, of
a character hotly contested, and severe, appear to have arisen in the
efforts necessary to secure <i>les deux "tries"</i>; for though no mention is
made of the Hospital ambulance, yet it is hinted that much
sticking-plasterre must have been used in fastening up and healing the
many contusions, grave, startling, and various, resulting from the
furious kicking of legs, and struggling of bodies, inevitable in the
progress of "<i>Un Scrimmage</i>" in which <i>Three-quarters-back</i>,
<i>'Arf-backs</i>, <i>Forwards</i>, and <i>even Goal-keeperes</i> were often mingled in
confusion, bewildering and prolonged, and only saved from being deadly
and prostrating by the admirable <i>&eacute;lan</i> and courageous spirit with which
it was encountered.</p>

<p>No, <i>mon cher Monsieur Punch</i>, I do not say that when our Athletic
Committee commence their investigations of the dangers obvious and
definite connected with the conduct of your <i>jeu de Cricquette</i>, that
they may not alter the constitution and weight of the ball, which I
understand is made of lead, and weighs ten pounds and three-quarters,
and reduce the size of <i>les batte-clubs</i>, themselves instruments to an
excessive degree ponderous and grotesque, probably eliminating entirely
from the field such dangerously-located officers as "Le Long-stoppe,"
"Le square-legge," and, above all, "Le wicket-keepere," but this does
not affect their action in considering the reformation of the rules for
the legitimate and reasonable conduct of the game of "Kicke-ball." No,
<i>mon cher Monsieur</i>, these they are agreeable to leave as they are,
remembering that the ball, formidable though he may be on account of his
size, is harmless as a butterfly in the contact, being filled only with
air. Moreover they see no reason to change when an "<i>Onze</i>" of this New
Athletic France can, with the old rules, claim as she does the noble
victory of <i>le deux</i> "tries" to nothing, and enables the writer of this
letter of correction, with a satisfaction that is keen and infinite, and
a pride that is profound and pardonable, to subscribe himself hereunder,</p>

<h2>OMNIBUSINESS.</h2>

<center>(<i>A Report of a Meeting yet to be held.</i>)</center>

<p>A meeting of the Improved Saloon Palace Coach Combination (Limited), was
held at the Offices of the Company on Thursday last, when Lord
<span class="smcap">Burlington Arcadia</span> (in the absence of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Utopia</span>) was called
upon to preside.</p>

<p>The noble Chairman said he was delighted to see so many
benevolent-looking shareholders present. He admitted that he felt a
little nervous, as no doubt the Board of Directors (of whom he had the
honour to be one) had acted to a great extent upon their own
responsibility in conducting the business of the Company. Encouraged by
the comments of the Press, the Board considered they owed a duty to the
Public second only in importance to the duty they owed to the
shareholders. Nowadays, great trading communities had no right to act
selfishly&mdash;they must think not only of those who owned the capital, but
also of that vast majority whose comfort it should be their pleasure to
enhance.</p>

<p>The paper to which he specially referred suggested that various
improvements should be made. All the Saloon Palace cars of the Company,
it was proposed, should be repainted in various colours, to facilitate
identification; but this would cost money&mdash;(<i>loud cheers</i>)&mdash;and he was
happy to say they had money to spend. They had spent it. (<i>Murmurs.</i>) He
was sure that they would be pleased when they learned the manner in
which that money had been spent. Instead of being hoarded up to swell
the dividend&mdash;(<i>groans.</i>)&mdash;it had been absorbed in improvements which
would confer great benefits upon the community. (<i>Uproar.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Shareholder.</span> What have we to do with the community?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span> explained that as the greater included the lesser, the
community must include the Shareholders. ("<i>No, no!</i>") He was sorry to
hear those sounds of dissent, but what had been done could not be
undone. (<i>Loud and prolonged groaning</i>). He trusted that he would be
treated with courtesy. ("<i>Hear, hear!</i>") He had come to the meeting at
considerable inconvenience. (<i>Cheers.</i>) As a matter of fact, he had
little stake in the Company, as some time since he had disposed of the
vast bulk of his shares. (<i>Groans.</i>) However, he would continue. As they
knew, the vehicles were now fitted with warm bottles in winter and
air-cushions in summer. Every passenger had a velvet upholstered
arm-chair. Flowers were supplied in great profusion in the interior of
the vehicles, and costly shrubs arranged on the platform supporting the
cushioned garden-seats of the exterior. As the additional weight to be
drawn in consequence of these improvements was considerable, it had been
considered advisable to increase the number of horses to each vehicle
from two to six. (<i>Groans.</i>) New routes had been selected&mdash;for instance,
special services of carriages had been arranged up and down the Belgrave
Road, the Mall, Hammersmith, the Upham Park Road, Chiswick, and round
Brompton Square. Then he might say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Shareholder.</span> We know all this, but how about the dividend? (<i>Cheers.</i>)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span> regretted the interruption. However, as the meeting wished
to enter into the subject of finance&mdash;(<i>cheers and cries of</i> "We
do")&mdash;he might say, that no dividend would be declared this half-year,
but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At this point of the proceedings there was a rush for the platform, and,
shortly afterwards, the meeting noisily separated.</p>

<p>We are informed, that the inquest upon the bodies of the Chairman and
his co-Directors, will be held early next week.</p>

<h4>A Distinguished Stranger.</h4>
</div>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March 3.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>, decently dressed in
black, stood at table to-night, reading through the space of an hour his
discourse on Report of Parnell Commission. A decorous, almost funereal
function. <span class="smcap">J. G. Talbot</span> enjoyed it thoroughly. "So like being in church
on Sunday afternoon," he said. "Wish <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> could have seen his
way to put on white neck-tie, and brought his notes bound up in black
cover."</p>

<p>Service proceeded very well without these details. <span class="smcap">Jemmy Lowther</span> early
fell victim to gentle influence of occasion. Long before <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>
had reached his fourthly, <span class="smcap">James</span>, with head reverently bent on his chest,
sweetly slept; dreamt he was a boy again, sitting in the family pew at
Easington-cum-Liverton, listening to his revered grandfather bubbling
forth orthodoxy. Up in Distinguished Strangers' Gallery sat a little boy
on his father's knee. Long he listened to the gentle murmur, broken now
and then by a yawn from a back bench, or the rustling of the manuscript
as it was turned over folio by folio. It was a great occasion for him;
his first visit to the Chamber which still echoed with the tones of his
father's uncle, <span class="smcap">John Bright</span>. He kept gallantly awake as quarter-hour
sped after quarter-hour, and then, reminiscent of a nursery story
somewhere told, his too audible whisper broke in upon the slumbering
gallery.</p>

<p>"Papa, hasn't the Gentleman brought his Amen with him?"</p>

<p>It came at last. Perhaps none so grateful as <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>. Curious to
note how, when beholding the welcome last folio of his discourse, <span class="smcap">Old
Morality</span>, uplifting his voice, said, "And now to&mdash;&mdash;", there was a
sudden movement in the crowd, a shuffling of feet, a rustling of
garments, a motion as if the congregation were about to rise to receive
the benediction. But <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> was only about to observe, "And now to
bring these imperfect remarks to a conclusion, I would entreat the House
to consider the great interests at stake, to vindicate the reputation of
this House, and to do their duty to their Queen and Country."</p>

<p>After peace, the storm. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> ruffled prevalent calm with a tornado
of virile eloquence. Grand Old Man in fine form. If he had had the
arrangement of course of events, nothing could have been more
successfully designed than the contrast. For <span class="smcap">Old Morality's</span> gentle
commonplaces, his pallid platitudes, his copy-book headings strung
together in timid flight after the Good and the True, here rushed a
flood of burning eloquence, carrying with it the whole audience;
jubilant the Opposition, faintly resisting the Ministerialists.
<span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> had no copy-book before him, only the merest skeleton of
notes. These, with what seemed to the intently-listening audience the
fewest, simplest touches, he informed and inflamed with flesh and blood.
Spoke for an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> hour and forty minutes&mdash;a marvellous feat for any man, a
miracle of mental and physical force for an octogenarian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick-Beach</span> followed; but spell broken; the listening throng, filling
the chamber from floor to topmost range of gallery, swiftly melted away.
Thus it came to pass there were few to see <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> as presently he went
forth whimpering. He, the champion slogger, accustomed to rampage round
the tents of the enemy, and bring his shillelagh down on any head
accidentally protruding, had been himself attacked. <span class="smcap">Hicks-Beach</span> girded
at him to-night in comparatively gentle fashion. <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> tossed about
on bench and pettishly protested; claimed <span class="smcap">Speaker's</span> protection; <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>
declined to interfere. Then, digging lusty knuckles into moist eyes, he
sobbed, "I&mdash;I&mdash;am not going to stay to be abused in this manner; shan't
play!" and so went forth, amid the jeers and mocking laughter of naughty
boys opposite. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Parnell Commission Report
opened.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Haven't seen anything more charming for a long time than
<span class="smcap">Elliott Lees'</span> plunge into debate on the Parnell Commission Report. Rose

reasonably be supposed to claim precedence, having Amendment on paper,
in addition to wide Parliamentary reputation. <span class="smcap">Lees</span> didn't even look at
Bart. Began his remarks, taking it as a matter of course that <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>
would call on him. House doesn't like <span class="smcap">Charles Lewis</span>, Bart., so called on
<span class="smcap">Lees</span>, and Bart. withdrew, angrily snorting.</p>

<p>Very few Members present. Getting on for dinner-hour. General conviction
that it's going to be a dull night. Nothing can help it. But <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>
waits, and presently, attracted by <span class="smcap">Lees'</span> superb sense of superiority,
sits with hand to ear, listening with kindly smile. Nothing delights
Grand Old Man so much as youth, especially aggressive youth&mdash;youth that
knows about everything, with fuller information and judgment more
accurate than its elders. This is what, years ago, first attracted him
to <span class="smcap">Randolph</span>. Now sits listening while <span class="smcap">Young Twenty-Nine</span>, who represents
Omniscience and Oldham, in drawling voice, hesitating for a word, but
having no hesitation in keeping the House waiting for it, settles the
question that for two years has riven parties and convulsed continents.</p>

<h4> W. Leave-em Bright.</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Twenty-Nine</span> knew all about it from the beginning. Wasn't born in
1860 for nothing. When his own party were rushing headlong down to
destruction, arranging for appointment of Commission, he had warned them
of their error. But no use going back on the irrevocable. Thing is, what
is to be done now? <span class="smcap">Young Twenty-Nine</span> casting patronising look on <span class="smcap">Old
Eighty</span>, listening on the Front Opposition Bench, would really like to
have voted for his Amendment. But, on his conscience, couldn't; too
strongly drawn, doncha; why hadn't he taken counsel of some young
friend, and drafted his Amendment with more moderation? At same time,
<span class="smcap">Young Twenty-Nine</span> couldn't do otherwise than condemn the <i>Times</i> for its
recklessness in publishing the forged letters. Generally approved the
conduct of <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>; regarded the proceedings of Irish Members
with mixed feelings, and, on the whole, would vote for Resolution.
Whereat <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>, long on tenterhooks, gave sigh of honest relief,
and Grand Old Man went off to dinner with a twinkle in his eye and an
amused smile lighting up his countenance. Writ moved to-night for new
election for Stoke, <span class="smcap">Willie Bright</span> having had enough of it. "Good-bye,
<span class="smcap">Toby</span>," he said, as he cleared out his locker; "they call me <span class="smcap">W. Leatham
Bright</span>, now I suppose it will be <span class="smcap">W. Leave-'em</span>."</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Curious little difficulty arose at meeting of House
to-day. No House to meet. On Wednesdays <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> takes chair at twelve
o'clock. Crosses Lobby, accompanied by Sergeant-at-Arms carrying Mace,
and tall gentleman in shorts carrying train. Walks up floor between rows
of Members, standing and bending heads like sheaves of corn over which
wind passes. To-day benches bare. Chamber empty. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> feels like one
who treads alone some banquet-hall deserted, whose guests are fled,
whose garlands dead, and all but he departed. Only in this case they
haven't arrived. <span class="smcap">Chaplain</span> in his place, ready to say his prayers.
Everything here but congregation. House, it is well known, thrilled with
excitement over Parnell Commission Report. Throbbing with anxiety to
debate it. Manages somehow to dissemble its feelings, smother its
aspirations. Presently two Members drop in; take their seats.</p>

<p>"Rather a small gathering," whispered the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Yes," says <span class="smcap">Chaplain</span>, forlornly looking round empty chamber. "A very
small gathering indeed; might almost call it a pimple."</p>

<p>Word scarcely Parliamentary in this connection.</p>

<p>"Order! order!" said the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, <i>sotto voce</i>; and, to avoid the
beginning of the sundering of friendship, <span class="smcap">Chaplain</span> read prayers.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Parnell Commission Report.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;For ordinary mild-mannered man, <span class="smcap">Justin McCarthy</span> to-night
dealt <span class="smcap">Charles Lewis</span>, Bart., what <i>The Marchioness</i> used to call "a
wonner." Yesterday, <span class="smcap">Lewis</span> delivered carefully prepared diatribe on
Report. Not particularly friendly to Ministers, especially <span class="smcap">Jokim</span>; but
death on Irish Members. <span class="smcap">McCarthy</span> to-day complained that, without giving
notice, Bart. had made personal attack on him; and, what was worse,
holding Report in hand, and purporting to quote from it, had misled
House on matter of fact.</p>

about the phrase being Parliamentary? Is there to be one rule for

to-night. Been piling up agony all week. Now nearing crisis. Lobbies
thrilling with excitement; corridors crowded with senators; competition
for <span class="smcap">Speaker's</span> eye threatens personal danger. A great occasion, a
memorable struggle. That's the sort of thing imagined outside by
ingenuous public. Fact is, when <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> came back from chop at twenty
minutes to nine, House almost as empty as on Wednesday afternoon. Count
called; bell rang; only thirty-five Members mustered; no quorum;
adjourned.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
